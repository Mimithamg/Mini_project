# PARK.IN

## Description
This is a project for Smart Parking System

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install): Download and install the Flutter SDK. Extract the downloaded file to a location on your machine.
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart): Dart SDK comes bundled with Flutter, so no separate installation is needed.
- **Code Editor**: Choose an editor such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA. Install the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for your chosen editor.
- **Update Flutter**: Periodically check for Flutter updates and update your Flutter SDK using the `flutter upgrade` command.
- **Run Flutter Doctor**: After installing Flutter, run `flutter doctor` in your terminal to diagnose any issues with your Flutter installation and ensure that all necessary components are installed and configured correctly.
- **Set Up iOS Simulator** (for macOS): Install Xcode from the Mac App Store if you haven't already. Then, open Xcode, go to `Preferences > Components`, and install the iOS simulator.

## Setting up with Android Studio (Optional)
If you prefer using Android Studio for Flutter development, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Android Studio: Download and install Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Configure Flutter SDK: After installing Android Studio, open it and configure the Flutter SDK path in the settings. You can do this by navigating to `Preferences/Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter` and providing the path to your Flutter SDK installation.
3. Install Emulator (for Android): If you plan to run your Flutter app on an Android emulator, you can set it up directly from Android Studio. Navigate to `Tools > AVD Manager` and create a new virtual device.
